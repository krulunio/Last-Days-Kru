mobs are biological, mechanical or both
what if mechanical mobs are made of bio silicone/plastic/metal/something
skeletons are really old

bones are primitive prosthesis
taming wolfs: parts from 'bone' are used to repair 'wolf'
bone meal: phosphate chemicals? probably dust/pellets
	phosphate is used by body to:
		build/repair bones (mechanical limbs)
		helping nerves functions (conectors between prosthesis and host)
		making muscles contract (artificial muscles)
	phosphate is also used by some fertilizers
fossils: big ass robot wreckage

bio skeletons: their arms/legs and other parts are replaced (crudely? profesionally?)
mech skeletons: their limbs are the same as prosthesis
