Global nuclear conflict ravaged world (temperature translates to radiation); before that, science was very advanced (magic = science), every place on Earth was either city (a lot of trees = a lot of shacks, and most people died BEFORE shack towns were build), factory (ores) or nature reserve (allows nature to exist or take over ruins), all of that apllies to oceans as well (underwater structures, gravel); same thing on Moon, but no civilians (every place in nether is dangerous, piglins are specialised workers), instead Moon was run by various industries (ores, lava = nuclear waste), scientists (nether is filled with magic) and militaries (structures, amount of nuclear waste, all piglins carry weapons).
Simulation theory (ST) is real (explains conflicting things), The End is like Backrooms (End poem, general strangeness of End, also conflicting/unexplainable/hard-to-explain stuff neeeds source sometimes).
Respawning is canon (it IS canon, because respawn anchor), somewhere in The End is machine run by AI (ST, works well with achievements, End is big and empty enough for machine to never be found), in hardcore machine is broken (no respawning, future MC updates may explain it), in creative it makes you a god/hacker (ST, free resource and flying), in spectator you are ghost (ST, can't interact with world).
